Known or possible RiskArena bugs.

1/18/13: Noticed that some results were not being counted or generated (ei the total number of points given out did not match how many should have been given out). The actual results were as follows:
Number of games - 100
Standings:
1. BurghBot 4 - 287 points
2. BurghBot 3 - 276 points
3. BurghBot 2 - 263 points
4. BurghBot 5 - 232 points
5. BurghBot 6 - 215 points
6. BurghBot - 197 points
Also these point totals are incorrect:
Number of games - 4000
Standings:
1. BurghBot 2 - 6741 points
2. BurghBot - 6284 points
3. BurghBot 3 - 5826 points
4. BurghBot 4 - 5032 points
