Add total elapsed time and avg game time to war game reports
Play/pause buttons during bots' turns

"Soon":

Handle edge adjacencies such as alaska-kamchatka.
Perhaps separately compile all bots and run some analysis to make sure they're not destructive to the computer running them and don't cheat.
