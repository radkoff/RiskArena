Short-term:
No longer require naming conventions for RiskBot files, consider all in riskbots directory (check dynamically if it implements RiskBot)
Make more maps
HOWTO for making maps
Replace magic numbers in RiskBot response protocol with static final answers (or enums?)

"Soon":
Refactor -
	Break up the largest of methods
	Separate UI and functionality of classes like WarGameReport
	Should Bot.RiskListener have a public constructor?
	Maybe GameInfo's GetCountryInfo shouldn't involve a full copying of the countries array?
	Split the MapReader constructor into smaller chunks
Make a static exit in Risk that prints the stack track (and closes file writers?), search for exits and use that instead
Separately compile all bots and run some analysis to make sure they're not destructive to the computer running them and don't cheat.
Allow for resizeability of the GameBoard window
Alterations of the GameBoard depending on the context of a player's turn. For example, when you select a country to attack from the foreign adjacencies should become highlighted. This will make playing as a human slightly easier.
Play/pause buttons during bots' turns
Integrate selected maps from http://www.conquerclub.com/maps/ (write a program to translate from their XML specification scheme to mine. See http://www.conquerclub.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=529&t=86562&start=0)

Long-term:
Unit testing
Map Creator program
Full GUI/map integration for easiest human playing experience. (ie click on countries to attack them)
Multiplayer via Internet using the client/server model
