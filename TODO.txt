Short-term:
Make another map or two
HOWTO for making maps

"Soon":
Separately compile all bots and run some analysis to make sure they're not destructive to the computer running them and don't cheat.
Allow for resizeability of the GameBoard window
Alterations of the GameBoard depending on the context of a player's turn. For example, when you select a country to attack from the foreign adjacencies should become highlighted. This will make playing as a human slightly easier.
Play/pause buttons during bots' turns
Integrate selected maps from http://www.conquerclub.com/maps/ (write a program to translate from their XML specification scheme to mine. See http://www.conquerclub.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=529&t=86562&start=0)

Long-term:
Map Creator program
Full GUI/map integration for easiest human playing experience. (ie click on countries to attack them)
Multiplayer via Internet using the client/server model
