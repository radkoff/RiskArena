HOWTO for making maps
Perhaps separately compile all bots and run some analysis to make sure they're not destructive to the computer running them and don't cheat.
Allow for resizeability of the GameBoard window
Possible alterations of the GameBoard depending on the game, beyond country ownership/armies. For example when you select a country to attack from, the foreign adjacencies are highlighted.
Play/pause buttons during bots' turns

Long-term:
Full GUI/map integration for easiest human playing experience. (ie click on countries to attack them)
Map Creator
Multiplayer via Internet using the client/server model
