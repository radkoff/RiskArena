Short-term:
Design Logo
close gameboard window when the game is over
"Bot speed" slider in gameboard

"Soon":
Play/pause buttons during bots' turns
Un-clutter Game.java
README
If a game is configured to be all AI, you can choose to simulate any number of games very quickly.
Handle edge adjacencies such as alaska-kamchatka.
Perhaps separately compile all bots and run some analysis to make sure they're not destructive to the computer running them and don't cheat.
Allow for resizeability of the window
After something is typed in cmd and the game is asking for a country, highlight in Pretty whatever countries are currently "in play"

Long-term:
Full GUI/map integration for easiest human playing experience. (ie click on countries to attack them)
Map Creator
Multiplayer via Internet using the client/server model
